# WAKE

## Inspiration
Inspired by previous degrees in psychology and media studies, our team tackled combining our dev skills with our past studies to improve online learning experiences. Have you ever found yourself drifting off during a Zoom lecture or struggling to stay awake while completing assignments? What about stressing out to get your code to run smoothly? We have all experienced those moments when our energy dips, and our productivity plummets. 

## What it does
Our WAKE detects your emotions to keep your mood happy and ensure you stay alert and focused throughout your online learning experience. With the assistance of our virtual coach,  StAIve, you will receive friendly reminders to keep smiling, enhancing your overall engagement and productivity.

## How we built it
- we used Google's mediapipe for the facial recognition
- React and Vite for the website and its components (in addition to Javascript, CSS, HTML)

## Challenges we ran into
- detecting the emotions that we want it to detect (and the sensitivity/accuracy of the detection)
- getting the website running the way we want it to (in accompaniment of the facial recognition/detection)
- getting the styling of the website (especially as different team members worked on different sections)

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- getting the facial detection to work and having it integrated with audio
- having staIve working : )
- the website looks very nice!

## What we learned
- how to build a website with React/Vite and make the design with DaisyUI and Tailwind
- how to integrate Google MediaPipe's facial detection software and adjust the settings to detect eyes closed and emotions like smiling or tiredness

## What's next for WAKE
We think there are a lot of implications and use in the future (such as detecting if a student is taking the test/reacting to the test elements in an online setting) and we hope to be able to add more functionality like an inspiriational quotes with staIve.
